# Daily learning Report
<h2>Day-1</h2>
<h3>Orientation:</h3>
My day is started with orientation program in the auditorium.Here our core branch (CSE) professer Dr.Priyanka introduce us with our department.Then our HOD Mam Dr.Kiran Joti introduce us with the new syllabus scheme.After that we were shifted to our respective labs.
<h5>Learning in lab</h5>
In lab first i have leared why the most of campanies and the coders use linux over windows?

This is because of the  following reasons:
- Linux is secure than window.
- Linux is open source.
- Linux is free , while windows required paid license.
- Linux has Large community

  I also learned about the product based and service based campines.From this i get that google, microsoft, flipcart are product based campanies.Product based campanies are mainly those campanies whose main focus is  in manking the project.They donot make campany projects.

After that we download three softwares.These are:
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS

We also learn about booting.Booting is the process of starting up or restarting a computer, which involves initializing hardware, loading the operating system, and preparing the computer for use.

Booting is of two types:
- Cold boot/hard boot: A state in which a computer is switched on from being switched off is referred to as cold booting. 
- Warm boot/soft boot: Soft boot or restart method Warm Booting, also called soft boots or restarts, reboots a computer system without shutting it down entirely. 
  
**This is all about the Day 1.*

<h2>Day-2</h2>
Second of learing linux.Today first revise the previous day work.
<h3>Kernel:</h3>
 The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. Think of it as as Chef working in a hotel. You as a coustmer can't see the chef working but get your order (output).
<h3>Shell:</h3>
 Shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Using the same scenario, think of shell as a waiter, who takes your order (input) and gives it to the chef (Kernel).

<h3>Day-3</h3>
In  the  third day of training,first we revise previous syllabus.After that we learn about
<h3>Dual Boot:</h3>
Dual booting allows a computer to run two different operating systems, enabling users to choose which one to boot into upon startup.

<h3>ISO file:</h3>
In Linux, an ISO file is a single file containing a complete copy of the data from a CD, DVD, or other optical media, formatted as an ISO 9660 file system. 

<h3>Bare metal installation:</h3>
It refers to setting up an operating system directly on a physical server's hardware, without any intervening virtualization layer like a hypervisor.

<h3>VMware and Virtual box:</h3>
VMware is a commercial product known for its enterprise-grade features, performance, and comprehensive support, while VirtualBox is an open-source, free alternative, generally favored for personal use, testing, and development. 

<h3>Partitioning schemes:</h3>
1. Dividing a hard disk into separate sections.

2.Each section (partition) acts like an independent disk.

3.Helps organize data and install multiple OS.

<h3>Types:</h3>
- MBR (Master Boot Record):

1. Max 4 primary partitions.

2. Supports up to 2 TB.

3. Older, used with BIOS.

**Day-4**

**File Compression:**

File compression is the process of reducing the size of a file or group of files so that they take up less storage space. It works by using algorithms to eliminate redundancy in the data.


- **Why Use File Compression?**
- To save storage space on your device or server.

- To speed up file transfers (e.g., via email or the internet).

- To bundle multiple files into a single, smaller package.

**Gzip Command:**

Gzip, short for GNU Zip, is a command-line compression tool commonly found on Linux systems. It utilizes the Deflatecompression algorithm to reduce the size of files, making them more manageable for storage and transmission.

**Syntax**

 gzip [Options] [filenames]

 ![gzip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02af937-ec1c-4361-94e2-0f4afaa1522e)


 **To save original file we use -k:**
 
 Compress a file and keep the original file, resulting in both the compressed and original files.

**Gunzip command:**

The gunzip command is used to decompress files that are already compressed in the zip format. Being a part of the GNU project, it compresses the data and appends the .gz extension to the file. Let's check out the syntax below:

Syntax: gunzip [Option] [archive name/file name]


![gun zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/802251f3-e190-4f83-94d6-802d70f5e4fa)


**Wild Cards:** 

| Wildcard   | Meaning                                | Example                        | Matches                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `*`        | Matches zero or more characters        | `ls *.txt`                     | `a.txt`, `notes.txt`, `file123.txt`        |
| `?`        | Matches exactly one character          | `ls file?.txt`                 | `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt` (not `file12.txt`)|
| `[ ]`      | Matches one character from the set     | `ls file[12].txt`              | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`                   |
| `[a-z]`    | Matches one character from a range     | `ls file[a-c].txt`             | `filea.txt`, `fileb.txt`, `filec.txt`      |
| `[! ]`     | Matches one character **not** in set   | `ls file[!0-9].txt`            | `filea.txt`, `fileX.txt` (not `file1.txt`) |
| `{ }`      | Brace expansion for multiple patterns  | `cp file{1,2,3}.txt /backup/`  | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt`      |


**[Assignment] What are  escape characters:**

Escape characters are special characters used to represent characters that are otherwise difficult or impossible to type directly in a string — like newline, tab, quotes, or backslashes.

They usually start with a backslash (\) to signal the shell, programming language, or interpreter to treat the next character differently.

| **Escape Character** | **Meaning**                      | **Example**              | **Output**                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `\n`                 | New line                         | `echo -e "Hello\nWorld"` | Hello<br>World                   |
| `\t`                 | Tab space                        | `echo -e "Hello\tWorld"` | Hello  World                     |
| `\\`                 | Backslash (`\`)                  | `echo -e "C:\\Users"`    | C:\Users                         |
| `\"`                 | Double quote (`"`)               | `echo -e "\"Hello\""`    | "Hello"                          |
| `\'`                 | Single quote (`'`)               | `echo -e "It\'s fine"`   | It's fine                        |
| `\a`                 | Alert (bell sound)               | `echo -e "\a"`           | (Makes a beep sound, if enabled) |
| `\b`                 | Backspace                        | `echo -e "Helloo\b"`     | Hello                            |
| `\r`                 | Carriage return (overwrite line) | `echo -e "123\rAB"`      | AB3 (replaces beginning chars)   |


**-e option in echo is used to enable interpretation of escape sequences.*

**Quoting in linux:**

 Quoting in Linux is used in the shell (like bash) to control how special characters are interpreted. It affects how strings and commands are parsed. 

 *Types of Quoting in Linux:*

 | Quote Type                      | Symbol    | Purpose                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single quotes**               | `' '`     | Prevent **all** interpretation of special characters. Everything is taken **literally**. |
| **Double quotes**               | `" "`     | Allow variable and command substitution, but prevent word splitting and globbing.        |
| **Backticks**                   | `` ` ` `` | Used for **command substitution** (older syntax).                                        |
| **Dollar sign and parentheses** | `$( )`    | Preferred method for **command substitution** (modern syntax).                           |
| **Escape character**            | `\`       | Escapes a **single character** (including quotes or spaces).                             |

**Difference between RAM and Cache Memory**

| Feature           | **RAM (Random Access Memory)**                               | **Cache Memory**                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Temporary memory used to store data and programs being used. | Very fast memory that stores frequently used CPU data.                     |
| **Speed**         | Slower than cache memory.                                    | Faster than RAM (very low latency).                                        |
| **Location**      | Located on the **motherboard** (separate chip or module).    | Located **inside** or **very close to** the CPU.                           |
| **Size**          | Larger (usually 4GB to 32GB or more).                        | Much smaller (typically 2MB to 64MB).                                      |
| **Cost**          | Cheaper per MB compared to cache.                            | More expensive per MB due to higher speed.                                 |
| **Function**      | Holds active programs and data for CPU access.               | Stores most recently used instructions/data to avoid re-fetching from RAM. |
| **Access by CPU** | Slower access compared to cache.                             | Direct and immediate access by CPU.                                        |
| **Volatility**    | Both are volatile (data lost when power is off).             | Both are volatile.                                                         |


**Why do we need Cache memory?*

- It helps the CPU work faster and more efficiently by reducing the time it takes to access data.
- Cache memory is much faster than RAM.
- It stores frequently used instructions and data, so the CPU doesn’t have to wait for slower RAM.
- Without cache, the Processor would waste cycles.
- So it is used to remove mismatch between RAM and Processor speed.

**Difference between RAM and Hard Disk**

| Feature              | **RAM (Random Access Memory)**                         | **Hard Disk (HDD/SSD)**                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type of Memory**   | **Volatile** memory (data is lost when power is off).  | **Non-volatile** memory (data is retained even when power is off). |
| **Function**         | Temporarily stores data and programs currently in use. | Permanently stores files, software, OS, and data.                  |
| **Speed**            | Much faster (in nanoseconds to microseconds).          | Slower (in milliseconds), though SSDs are faster than HDDs.        |
| **Storage Capacity** | Smaller (usually 4GB to 32GB).                         | Larger (typically 500GB to several TBs).                           |
| **Cost**             | More expensive per GB.                                 | Cheaper per GB.                                                    |
| **Location**         | Mounted on motherboard as modules.                     |                                                                    |


**Process of Booting**

| Step                             | Process Description                                                                                                                                  |

| **1. Power On**                  | You press the **power button** on the computer. Power Supply Unit (PSU) activates and sends power to motherboard components.                         |
| **2. POST (Power-On Self Test)** | BIOS/UEFI runs POST to check if essential hardware like RAM, CPU, and keyboard are working. If something fails, a beep code or message is shown.     |
| **3. BIOS/UEFI Execution**       | Basic firmware (BIOS/UEFI) initializes system hardware and looks for a **bootable device** (like hard drive, SSD, or USB).                           |
| **4. Boot Loader Execution**     | BIOS hands control to the **bootloader** (e.g., GRUB for Linux, BOOTMGR for Windows) found in the **Master Boot Record (MBR)** or **EFI partition**. |
| **5. OS Kernel Loading**         | Bootloader loads the **operating system kernel** (the core of the OS) into RAM.                                                                      |
| **6. OS Initialization**         | Kernel sets up system services, drivers, and background processes.                                                                                   |
| **7. User Login**                | Once everything is loaded, the **login screen** or **desktop interface** appears. The system is now ready to use.                                    |
