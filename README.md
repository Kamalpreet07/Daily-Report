# TRCS-201
**The daily diary training report.**
<h2>Day-1</h2>
<h3>Orientation:</h3>
My day is started with orientation program in the auditorium.Here our core branch (CSE) professer Dr.Priyanka introduce us with our department.Then our HOD Mam Dr.Kiran Joti introduce us with the new syllabus scheme.After that we were shifted to our respective labs.
<h5>Learning in lab</h5>
In lab first i have leared why the most of campanies and the coders use linux over windows?

This is because of the  following reasons:
- Linux is secure than window.
- Linux is open source.
- Linux is free , while windows required paid license.
- Linux has Large community

  I also learned about the product based and service based campines.From this i get that google, microsoft, flipcart are product based campanies.Product based campanies are mainly those campanies whose main focus is  in manking the project.They donot make campany projects.

After that we download three softwares.These are:
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
