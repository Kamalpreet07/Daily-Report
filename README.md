# Daily learning Report
<h2>Day-1</h2>
<h3>Orientation:</h3>
My day is started with orientation program in the auditorium.Here our core branch (CSE) professer Dr.Priyanka introduce us with our department.Then our HOD Mam Dr.Kiran Joti introduce us with the new syllabus scheme.After that we were shifted to our respective labs.
<h5>Learning in lab</h5>
In lab first i have leared why the most of campanies and the coders use linux over windows?

This is because of the  following reasons:
- Linux is secure than window.
- Linux is open source.
- Linux is free , while windows required paid license.
- Linux has Large community

  I also learned about the product based and service based campines.From this i get that google, microsoft, flipcart are product based campanies.Product based campanies are mainly those campanies whose main focus is  in manking the project.They donot make campany projects.

After that we download three softwares.These are:
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS

We also learn about booting.Booting is the process of starting up or restarting a computer, which involves initializing hardware, loading the operating system, and preparing the computer for use.

Booting is of two types:
- Cold boot/hard boot: A state in which a computer is switched on from being switched off is referred to as cold booting. 
- Warm boot/soft boot: Soft boot or restart method Warm Booting, also called soft boots or restarts, reboots a computer system without shutting it down entirely. 
  
**This is all about the Day 1.*

<h2>Day-2</h2>
Second of learing linux.Today first revise the previous day work.
<h3>Kernel:</h3>
 The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. Think of it as as Chef working in a hotel. You as a coustmer can't see the chef working but get your order (output).
<h3>Shell:</h3>
 Shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Using the same scenario, think of shell as a waiter, who takes your order (input) and gives it to the chef (Kernel).

Shell is divided into two categories:

1.Command Line Shell:

2. Graphical Shell:

Types of shell are:
- BASH
- Sh
- Zsh
- Fish

<h3>File Structure:</h3>

<h3>Commands:</h3>
The most interesting part is cammands which we learn today and then we practice these commands.

1. ls: Displays information about files in the current directory.
2. whoami: Displays the current users name.
3. date: A simple but powerful tool used to display the current date and time, as well as set the system date and time.

4. cd: To navigate between different folders.
5. mkdir: Creates a directory.

6. cat: Display file contents on terminal.
7. touch: Create empty files.
8. cp: Copy files from one directory to another.

9. pwd: Displays the current working directory.
10. whereis: View the exact location of any command typed after this command.
11. whatis: The whatis command displays the header line from the manual section.
12. mv: Rename and Replace the files.

Today we learn and enjoy these all commands.


<h3>Day-3</h3>
In  the  third day of training,first we revise previous syllabus.After that we learn about
<h3>Dual Boot:</h3>
Dual booting allows a computer to run two different operating systems, enabling users to choose which one to boot into upon startup.

<h3>ISO file:</h3>
In Linux, an ISO file is a single file containing a complete copy of the data from a CD, DVD, or other optical media, formatted as an ISO 9660 file system. 

<h3>Bare metal installation:</h3>
It refers to setting up an operating system directly on a physical server's hardware, without any intervening virtualization layer like a hypervisor.

<h3>VMware and Virtual box:</h3>
VMware is a commercial product known for its enterprise-grade features, performance, and comprehensive support, while VirtualBox is an open-source, free alternative, generally favored for personal use, testing, and development. 

<h3>Partitioning schemes:</h3>
1. Dividing a hard disk into separate sections.

2.Each section (partition) acts like an independent disk.

3.Helps organize data and install multiple OS.

<h3>Types:</h3>
- MBR (Master Boot Record):

1. Max 4 primary partitions.

2. Supports up to 2 TB.

3. Older, used with BIOS.

4. less flexible

- GPT (GUID Partition Table):
  
1. Supports 128+ partitions.
   
2.Works with disks >2 TB.

3.Newer, used with UEFI.

4.more flexible

<h3>Permissions & Shell programming:</h3>
<h3>File and directory permissions:</h3>
chmod (Change mode): It is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.


Some different chmod permission notations are:
- chmod +x test.sh: Gives permission to run the script.
- chmod 444 test.sh: Changes file to read-only.

<h3>Redirection:</h3>

<h3>Types of Redirection:</h3>
1. Overwrite Redirection (For stdout):
Redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists already contain script, it will be overwritten.
">" standard output.

2. Append Redirection (For stdout): Append the output to the file without compromising the existing data of the file.
